# Timeline info
timeline:
- year: 2015
  header: A Team reborn
  details: Team 5730, The Profressionals was started by the three students from Monett High School when they found themselves the last remaining members of FRC Team 3784. They decided that a team associated with the school would be more sustainable than a standalone team. In our inguaral year, we attended the regional competition in Olkahoma City. While we didn't do as well as we'd liked in the competition, we won the Rookie All-Star Award. This award qualified us for a spot at the World Championship. We also attended the Missouri State Championship event where we were on the Second place alliance.
